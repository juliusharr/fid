<h2>Low and Slow</h2>

<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2024</p>

<p>
This week I am <em>extremely excited</em> about a new cooking technique called sous vide.
In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food in a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
</p>

<p>
Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>.
To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
