    <h1>About Jen’s Kitchen</h1>

    <p>
      The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. 
      In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, 
      but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. 
      <i>Bon Appetit!</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. 
      One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.
